Hello, and welcome to WOLF Technologies.
I am Toxic Wolf, CEO and founder of the company.
Here, we develop a vast range of Operating
Systems and pieces of software that cater to many
different situations and requirements.

A tour of the facility will commence shortly
after this presentation. Please stand clear of
the blast doors, and remain in close proximety
to a member of tourguide personnel at all times,
or you risk serious injury. You are purely
responsible for the concequences of being found
in prohibited sectors unattended. Toilets are on
Level 0, adjacent to the main entrance.

WolfOS is designed to be a cutting edge domestic
OS for your home computers, whereas WOLFNB is
the latest News Board suite for displaying
important information in your servers.

Similarly, WolfDB will be the software of choice
for shop owners and server admins alike when
in need of powerful and easy-to-setup display
boards, such as shop signs, offer displays,
road signs and much more.

Software to provide interface support with
existing WOLF Technologies products for the
highly popular mobile robotic 'Turtles' is
currently in planning, and will be officially
announced at a press conference sometime later
this year.
